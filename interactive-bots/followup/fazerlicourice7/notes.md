Took me a while to figure out that the url should be only localhost:9991 not 'localhost:9991/#' as it was in my browser.

running the bot script in the vm, with python 2 had some errors, so I had to use python 3 and install whatever dependencies it wanted.

Either the user or a bot can be used for the api key and email. 

Also, it doesn't matter where the .zuliprc-local file is, but it should be referenced correctly each time.
