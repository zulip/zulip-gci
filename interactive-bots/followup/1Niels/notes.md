The instructions did an impressive job of introducing interactive bots. 
The only issue I experienced was in writing the wrong dev-url. 
Instead of adding 1Niels.zulipdev.org:9991 I added 1Niels.zulipdev.org without the port.
Furthermore, I would consider stating that you can use either a bot or the user for using followup in one sentence rather than stating the instructions for obtaining the API keys as a user and then stating you can also create a bot.
