#Followup Bot
##Issues
* I created `.zuliprc-local` in ~/zulip, so I had to fix the command call at some point
* I forgot to invite the bot to the stream I was using `@followup` in
* There's no sign of error if you try to notify the bot in a stream that it's not in which means I thought it wasn't working
