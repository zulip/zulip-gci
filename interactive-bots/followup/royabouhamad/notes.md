At first I was getting an error saying that some modules didn’t exist that were used in the python files. I fixed this by running a pip command to install the simplejson module.
I then began running the command with ‘python3’ at the start instead of ‘python’, this seemed to solve all the other problems I had with modules not existing.
Problems also arose with the my .zuliprc-local file when the terminal could not find it to run the command. After some discussion on the GCI help stream I found that my error was not adding the .txt to the end of the command as the command did not have the full file name and therefore was not working.
Once that was working the messages were not being sent through to the followup stream, after more discussion on the GCI help stream it was found that I was not using the correct credentials for the API key due to me destroying the vagrant environment the previous day. 
After this there were no more problems and it worked fine.
