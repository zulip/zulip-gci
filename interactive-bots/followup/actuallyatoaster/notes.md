I had a little bit of difficulty at first because I didn't realize that site should equal localhost:9991 instead of actuallyatoaster.zulipdev.org.

I noticed that there is an option to just download the zuliprc file.

I was a little confused because I never tried to make a stream before, but that was very straight-froward.

I had some problems with the provision before starting this task, but I know that's not related.

I think this guide was far more eas to understand than the one for zulip integrations.
