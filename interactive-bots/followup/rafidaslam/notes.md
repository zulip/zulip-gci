### Test the followup bot

This is my first time run interactive bot in Zulip. It's so interesting, at first 
I think Zulip not have it, it turned out Zulip have it. After I look at the bot codes,
it turns out this bot is very simple and not as complicated as I thought. To
enable the bot, we only need a few components such as a config file for the bot
(that contains API key, email, and server url) and the bot file itself.

The advantages of this bot in my opinion are:
- Simple.
- Easy to understand.
- Easy to set up.
- Easy to run.

Disadvantages of this bot in my opinion is:
- Must use two terminals (one as server and the other as the bot launcher).
