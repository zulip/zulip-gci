I experienced virtually no issues along the way as the task instructions did a great job of explaining interactive bots.
The only part I had trouble with was placing the .zuliprc-local file in the correct location (because I didn't realises that the bot had to be external to the Dev environment).
I now think that I have a good understanding of contrib-bots and its uses.
