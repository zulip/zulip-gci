I wasn't sure what my development environment URL was, and so I had to ask my mentor about that. Also, I put the wrong api key and email address into the .zuliprc-local file. I used my personal zulip account's api key and email address, and as a result the bot didn't work. Thankfully, after reading some of the errors. I managed to figure out why the bot wasn't working, and changed the api key to be a user running on my development enviroment server. After changing that, everything went smoothly, and I got the bot working.
