Andrew's Link Bot Notes
=======================

After a small hickup where the bot wasn't doing anything and I couldn't figure out why, I just did `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` and ran the server again, regenerated the bot's API keys and it worked. Don't know why it fixed it, but it did!
Perhaps there was some config error with the server, which makes sense that it would work after recreating the Vagrant VM if that was the case.
