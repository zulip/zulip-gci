1. Instead of creating the new branch in zulip-gci, I created it in Zulip and was confused by the absence of the 'interactive-bots' folder.

2. When checking if the bot works, I initially forgot to run the bot with run.py. Rereading task A helped me out.

3. It might be of interested for future students tackling this problem that the .zuliprc configuration file can be downloaded from the server with the correct settings.
