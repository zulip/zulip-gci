This time I did not ran into troubles, except because I didn't understood the instructions at the beginning:

Duplicate the followup.py file under links.py, to build on existing code.

This should at least give some instructions about where the followup.py files is from, specifically if someone skipped task A he won't have any idea of what is happening.
