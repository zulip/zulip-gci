## **Interactive bots by running the links bot**  ##

**I have faced some issues and here are the conclusions:**

* Always do the first step i.e, make it respond to `@links` and `@resource` in
followup stream and if successful only after that try to make it private. 
* If possible try to type the code instead of copy-pasting it. It would prevent
Your bot from not responding.
* I've faced the same issue and after hand-typing it, my bot worked.
