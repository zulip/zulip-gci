## joyhchen Notes

- I forgot to change the message sent at first and had to review my steps.
- I typed the if statement in handle_message before original_sender was defined and had to go back and move it.
- The instructions say to run the command outside of the VM, but I was getting errors when typing was being imported, so I decided to run it inside the VM and had to move my .zuliprc-local file.
