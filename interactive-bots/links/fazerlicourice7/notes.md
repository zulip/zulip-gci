When I first ran the links bot, got the error that the 'LinkHandler' class didn't exist.

The error was caused by me incorrectly editing the code at one point- I left out an 's' in 'Links'.

It didn't work correctly even after that, because I hadn't subscribed my bot to all the streams.

Got multiple python errors: hadn't completely edited all the variable names in link.py.

After I fixed all those python errors, it ran fine. I had run the followup bot already, so I had
sorted out the problems with running it already.

Now you can download the zuliprc file for any bot. This is much easier than earlier, when I made minor
typos in my file which caused me to be unable to run it correctly.
