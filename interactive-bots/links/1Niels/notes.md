The tutorial did a great job of building on top of the the followup bot tutorial in task A. 
My only mistakes included writing the zuliprc file incorrectly and forgetting to change the `handle_message`.
Also, I would consider mentioning that Zulip allows you to download the zuliprc file for any given bot or user.
