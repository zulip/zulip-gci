When I started my Zulip development server, I needed to run vagrant provision to get it working. Also, after changing the handle_message method, my bot was not working as expected. The bot's messages were not being sent as a private message. I restarted the bot, reloaded the Zulip webpage, and the bot worked perfectly.
