One of the problems I did encounter was the instruciton where it says to copy the folloup.py to links.py 
to build on existing code. I tried looking for links.py, but after clarifying it I then realized that you actually 
had to duplicate followup.py and rename the file into links.py. 

After that, I had a bit of trouble testing because I wasn't sure what to see after doing the changes in the code.
At first it didn't work, but it turned out to be just my server problem. After getting my server to work I finally saw
the result.
