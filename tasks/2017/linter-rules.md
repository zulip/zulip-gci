# GCI Tasks: Linter rules

## Prerequisites

* A working Zulip development environment. See
  [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/README.md) for
  instructions on how to set one up.

* Basic knowledge of git. We **strongly suggest** you finish the
  [Get Comfortable With Git](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/tasks/5415336817983488/)
  task first before attempting this.

* You need to know how to create a GitHub pull request. Check out the
  [Learn how to create a GitHub Pull Request](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/tasks/4884433561714688/)
  task if you aren't sure how to do this, or read through the task
  description [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/tasks/2017/submit-a-pull-request.md).

* Update your working copy of Zulip and then create a feature branch. [Learn
  how](../../before-every-task.md).

## Task Description

Linter rules are regexes that automatically check our codebase for errors.
