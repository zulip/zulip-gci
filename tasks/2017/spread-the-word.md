# GCI Tasks: Spread The Word

## Background

Upvotes and reviews make a big difference in the public perception of projects
like Zulip.

## Task description

In this task, we will ask you to rate and review Zulip on some technology sites.
You're free to decide whether or not to do each individual task, but we do ask
that you do at least five of the social media marketing tasks in order to get
credit for the overall task. We expect completing all the tasks will take about
90 minutes.

Start by opening up a text file. You will be putting links and screenshots in
this file in order to prove that you have completed parts of the task. We'll
call this file the submission file.

### Star us on GitHub.

There are four main repositories:
[server/web](https://github.com/zulip/zulip),
[mobile](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile),
[desktop](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron), and [Python
API](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api). For each repository, star the
repository, and then write down the number of stars that repository has in
your submission file.

### Share Zulip on StackShare

1. Create an account at StackShare. Add your name and a picture, [i.e. do the
work to have a real profile].

2. Think of six technology products you really like, and consider adding Zulip
to that list.

3. For each product in 2: Add the product to your Stack, star it, and upvote at
least three reasons why people like product that you find compelling.

4. Add a link to your profile to your submission file. The link should look like
https://stackshare.io/Lyla-Fischer, but replace Lyla-Fischer with your
username.

### Write a review on the android play store

1. Rate and review Zulip in the android play store. Five star reviews go a
long way toward letting people know that Zulip is a quality product.

2. Go to the Zulip app’s entry in the play store, scroll down to the “my
review” section, and take a screenshot of your review and add that
screenshot to your submission file.

### Write a review on the ios app store.

1. Rate and review Zulip in the iOS app store. Five star reviews go a long way
toward letting people know that Zulip is a quality product.

2. Add a description of which review is yours in the app store. We will take
a look at your review and the submission time in the store.

### Share Zulip on alternativeto.net

1. Get your parent’s permission to make an account, and fill out your profile.
Link to at least one external social media account.

2. Think of 2-4 products you use, and upvote (“Like”) them. To get to a product,
search for it in the “I want to replace” bar in the upper right. Zulip's profile
is [here](https://alternativeto.net/software/zulip-chat-server/) 

3. For each of the products in 2, consider their competitors, and go to those
competitors pages and list those products as good alternatives. Zulip is
considered by many to be a good alternative to
[Slack](https://alternativeto.net/software/slack/)

3. Add a link to your profile to your submission file. Your profile link
should look like https://alternativeto.net/user/aviendha1591/, but replace
aviendha1591 with your username.

### Submit your submission file

When you finish the task, save your submission file as a PDF and submit it to
us in the GCI app.
