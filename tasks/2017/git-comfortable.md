# Get Comfortable With Git

This task will familiarize you with Git, which is the version control system
all GitHub projects, including Zulip, use.

In this task, you'll learn both the Git basics as well as read
resources that will help you move towards being an advanced user of
Git.

## Prerequisites

* A working Git installation. See [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

* A suitable terminal. This is the built-in terminal client on Linux and OS X,
 and Git Bash on Windows (assuming you installed Git on Windows).

## Task

* Read the GitHub [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial and follow
  the steps. Take a **screenshot** of a successfully merged pull request in your
  `hello-world` repository.

* Work through the [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) tutorial. Take a
  **screenshot** of the final page with your badge.

  This tutorial uses `git pull` - we recommend using `git pull --rebase`
  instead, as it will help you avoid conflicts in your repository.

* Complete some of the [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  exercises. We would recommend completing at least the first 8. Take a
  **screenshot** of the `levels` selection screen.

* Get used to the idea of
  [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages).
  Zulip uses a rebase-oriented workflow.

* Check out the
  [Zulip Git Guide](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/overview.html)
  and skim each of the sub-articles, so you know what's in there.
  This guide has a lot of helpful information, guides, and techniques
  that you'll want to be able to call on in the future.

* Install a [installing a graphical Git repository viewer](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/setup.html#get-a-graphical-client)
  and take a **screenshot** of it running.

* Get familiar with the [Zulip Git guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html) -
  it's a useful point of reference if you:
    * [want more help with installing Git locally](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/setup.html)
    * [need a quick reference of Git terms](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/terminology.html)
    * [are setting up Zulip locally](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/cloning.html)
    * [want to get comfortable working with Git](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/using.html)
    * [need to fix commits](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/fixing-commits.html)
    * [run into trouble](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/troubleshooting.html)

  and many more!

* If you're curious to learn more about how Git works, watch
  [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Msq90ZknI)!  Reading
  [our guide on how Git works](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/the-git-difference.html)
  and the articles linked from there is also a great way to get deeper into
  learning Git.

## Submission

Submit the four screenshots in the GCI app and provide a link to your
`hello-world` repository.

If you're not sure how to take screenshots, [this guide](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/screenshot-and-gif-software.html)
should be helpful.

## Completion criteria

Mentors will check that the student uploaded 4 screenshots for:
- a merged pull request in their `hello-world` repository
- a final page of the "Try Git" tutorial with their badge
- a screenshot of the `levels` selection screen for "Learn Git Branching"
  exercises, with at least the first 8 exercises marked as completed
- a running GUI client for Git

The submission should also include a link to the student's `hello-world`
repository on GitHub.
