# Get Comfortable With Git

This task will familiarize you with Git, which is the version control system
all GitHub projects, including Zulip, use.

## Prerequisites

* A working Git installation. See [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

* A suitable terminal. This is the built-in terminal client on Linux and OS X,
 and Git Bash on Windows (assuming you installed Git on Windows).

## Task

* Read the GitHub [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial and follow
  the steps. Take a **screenshot** of a successfully merged pull request in your
  `hello-world` repository.

* Work through the [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) tutorial. Take a
  **screenshot** of the final page with your badge.

  This tutorial uses `git pull` - we recommend using `git pull --rebase`
  instead, as it will help you avoid conflicts in your repository.

* Complete some of the [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  exercises. We would recommend completing at least the first 8. Take a
  **screenshot** of the `levels` selection screen.

* Get used to the idea of
  [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages).
  Zulip uses a rebase-oriented workflow.

* Check out the
  [Zulip Git Guide](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/overview.html)
  and skim each of the sub-articles, so you know what's in there.
  This guide has a lot of helpful information, guides, and techniques
  that you'll want to be able to call on in the future.

* Install a [installing a graphical Git repository viewer](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/setup.html#get-a-graphical-client)
  and take a **screenshot** of it running.

* Get familiar with the [Zulip Git guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html) -
  it's a useful point of reference if you:
    * [want more help with installing Git locally](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/setup.html)
    * [need a quick reference of Git terms](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/terminology.html)
    * [are setting up Zulip locally](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/cloning.html)
    * [want to get comfortable working with Git](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/using.html)
    * [need to fix commits](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/fixing-commits.html)
    * [run into trouble](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/troubleshooting.html)

  and many more!

* If you're curious to learn more about how Git works, watch
  [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Msq90ZknI)!  Reading
  [our guide on how Git works](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/the-git-difference.html)
  and the articles linked from there is also a great way to get deeper into
  learning Git.

## Submission

Submit the four screenshots in the GCI app and provide a link to your
`hello-world` repository.

## Completion criteria

Mentors will check that the student uploaded 4 screenshots for:
- a merged pull request in their `hello-world` repository
- a final page of the "Try Git" tutorial with their badge
- a screenshot of the `levels` selection screen for "Learn Git Branching"
  exercises, with at least the first 8 exercises marked as completed
- a running GUI client for Git

The submission should also include a link to the student's `hello-world`
repository on GitHub.
