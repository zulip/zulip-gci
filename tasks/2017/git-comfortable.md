# Get Comfortable With Git

This task will familiarize you with `git`, which is the version control system
all GitHub projects, including Zulip, use.

## Prerequisites

* A working `git` installation. See [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

* A suitable terminal. This is the built-in terminal client on Linux and OS X,
 and Git Bash on Windows (assuming you installed Git On Windows).

## Task

* Read the GitHub [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial and follow
  the steps. Take a **screenshot** of a successfully merged pull request in your
  `hello-world` repository.

* Work through the [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) tutorial. Take a
  **screenshot** of the final page with your badge.

* Complete some of the [Learn Git Branching](http://learnGegitbranching.js.org/)
  exercises. We would recommend completing at least the first 8. Take a
  **screenshot** of the `levels` selection screen.

* Get used to the idea of
  [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages).
  Zulip uses a rebase-oriented workflow.

* If you're curious about how `git` works, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Msq90ZknI)!
