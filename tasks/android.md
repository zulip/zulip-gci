# Zulip Android GCI Tasks: User Documentation

## Prerequisites

* Install Zulip Android on your android device.
* Have an account on zulip to sign in through your device

## Background

Good user guides help users and search engines discover Zulip features. They
are important since they are a medium through which we present Zulip to our
potential users and contributors. These task involves writing a user
guide for our application.

## Task Descriptions

* Play with the Zulip Android project and get to know how the application 
  functions.
* Write the documentation for the task. It should be in the readthedocs.io 
  format (Read the Docs hosts documentation, making it fully searchable 
  and easy to find.) 
  See this one for example https://zulip.readthedocs.io
  For readthedocs you can refer this page 
  https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
  
*  Put the documenatation and screenshots into a new directory
  `docs/' in the zulip android project.
* Post your work as a pull request in the zulip/zulip-android
  repository. The title of the pull request should be "Documentation: *task*"

* Completion criteria: Make sure you have covered the features mentioned in the 
  check list. Mentors will check that the information is correct and complete.

## General Notes

* It is *extremely important* that you not copy text or images from other
products’ documentation. The companies that develop those products own the
copyright to their documentation. If you are not sure what constitutes
copying, please ask on the [TODO] stream at chat.zulip.org!

* Some examples of good user guides:

** Let us know if you find others, and we'll add them here!
