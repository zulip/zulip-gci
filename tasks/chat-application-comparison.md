# Comparison with other chat tools

Help us prepare the comparison page between Zulip and other chat
tools, with a matrix of which features each product has or doesn't
have. There are 5 sets of tasks in this section. The first 3 types
involves testing whether a given set of features is present in a chat
application. The last 2 sets contains open ended questions. You have
to work on only one chat application for testing the features. The GCI
task description should tell you which chat application and set you
should be testing.

* You have to create a new team in the third party chat application and 
refer to the docs for completing most of the tasks. 

* Try to submit link to documentation whenever you can. If not possible 
screenshots are good.
