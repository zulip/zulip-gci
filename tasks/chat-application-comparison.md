# Comparison with other chat tools

Help us prepare the comparison page between Zulip and competing chat
tools, with a matrix of which features each product has or doesn't
have. To do this you will need to use the other chat tools and
determine if they have or do not have the given features.

There are 5 sets of tasks in this section. The first 3 sets involve
testing whether a features from a given list are present in a
competing chat application. The last 2 sets contain open-ended
questions.

You only have to test one competing chat application for the listed
features.  The GCI task description should tell you which chat
application and set of features you should be testing.

* You should refer to the competing chat application's documentation
in order to complete most of the tasks here.  You will likely also
need to sign up for and create a new team in the competing chat
application, so that you can play around with their UI and determine
if features exist which aren't documented.

* The best way to prove that a feature exists in your output is to
link to the competing chat application's documentation.  If a feature
exists in a product, but isn't documented, then the best proof is to
take one or more screenshots demonstrating it in action.
