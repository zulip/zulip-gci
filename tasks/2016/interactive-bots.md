# GCI Tasks: Interactive bots

## Prerequisites

* A working Zulip development environment. See
  [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/README.md) for
  instructions on how to set one up.

* You need to know how to create a GitHub pull request. Check out the
  [Learn how to create a GitHub Pull Request](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/6541581402243072/)
  task if you aren't sure how to do this, or read through the task
  description [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/tree/master/submit-a-pull-request).

* Update your working copy of Zulip and then create a feature branch. [Learn
  how](../before-every-task.md).

## Background

[Zulip bots](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip_bots)
is a boilerplate for creating interactive bots that react to messages sent
by users.

The interactive bots live in the [`zulip_bots/bots/`](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip_bots/zulip_bots/bots) directory with a sub-directory for each bot.
Each bot directory has python files ('.py') that define their specific behavior,
have automated tests and documentation explaining its behavior. The overall directory structure of zulip bots can be seen [here](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip_bots#directory-structure).

The following tasks will introduce you to using interactive bots and creating
simple new bots that react to messages. This group of tasks has a high creative potential,
as you can create your own bots (with complete automated tests) that react to specific messages
and can be integrated with various APIs.

## Task Descriptions

There are four types of tasks in this category, each corresponding to one of
the Task Types below.

### Task Type A: Learn about interactive bots by running the followup bot

Follow the tutorial below to test run the followup bot on your Zulip
instance (either local or in your droplet).

* Any bot in [`zulip_bots/bots/`](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip_bots/zulip_bots/bots) can [run](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running-bots-guide.html#running-a-bot)
on a running Zulip server by replacing `<bot-name>` by any of the existing valid bot name
(under `zulip_bots/bots/`). Replace `<bot-name>` by `followup` for this tutorial.

* Create a `followup` stream on your Zulip server.

* Use `Manage Streams` to subscribe your bot (if you created one) to the
following streams: `devel`, `social`, and `followup`.

* Test manually that the followup bot is working on the local Zulip instance,
by:

 - sending a few messages starting with `@<your-active-bot-name>` from
 different streams, such as `devel` and `social`. `<your-active-bot-name>` is the
 name of the bot that you had given while creating a bot [initially](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running-bots-guide.html#running-a-bot)(Settings -> Your bots -> Add a new bot).

 - checking that the messages showed up in the `followup` stream, prepended
 by the sender email

* Take screenshots showing that the bot is working, make sure to have
screenshots of:

 - your terminal window with the bot running, including the command you used
 to run the bot and the output with the bot description
 - messages sent by you to the bot in the `devel` and `social` streams
 - messages sent by the bot in the `followup` stream
 - any other screenshots you find relevant

  Add the screenshots to `interactive-bots/followup/<username>/`. Make sure
  your filenames do not have white-spaces. Instead, use dashes (`-`).

* Note down any places you got stuck, problems or errors you ran into while
doing this setup process. Add your notes as a `notes.md` file to
`interactive-bots/followup/<username>/`.

* Create a commit with the screenshots and notes, with commit message
`interactive bots: Run the followup bot for <username>.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip-gci` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Run the followup bot for <username>`. Link to your GCI
task in comment section.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check that the followup bot was properly
set up.

### Task Type B: Learn about interactive bots by creating a links bot

We recommend completing Task Type A before doing this task.

Follow the tutorial below to create your first simple bot that sends private
messages to users.

* Make a copy of `followup.py` located in `contrib_bots/lib` and name it
`links.py`, to build on existing code.
  ```
  cp followup.py links.py
  ```


* Change the class name to `LinksHandler` and the last line to `handler_class
= LinksHandler`.


* Edit the comment  in `class LinksHandler(object)` appropriately:

  > This plugin facilitates creating a list of resources you want to save
  while using Zulip. It looks for messages starting with "@link" or
  "@resource".
  > In this example, we send resources to private messages.

* Edit the return statement in `def usage(self)`:

  > This plugin will allow users to flag messages as being resources and
  store them in private messages with the bot. Users should preface messages
  with "@link" or "@resource".


* Edit the comments of `triage_message`:

  ```
  # This next line of code is defensive, as we
  # never want to get into an infinite loop of posting links
  # for own links!
  ```


* Edit the if statements of `triage_message`:

  ```
  if message['display_recipient'] == 'followup':
      return False
  is_link = (original_content.startswith('@link') or
             original_content.startswith('@resource'))

  return is_link
  ```

  The bot now responds to messages starting with `@link` and `@resource`.


* Edit the if statements of `handle_message`:

  ```
  if original_content.startswith('@link'):
      new_content = original_content.replace('@link',
                                         'from %s:' % (original_sender,))
  else:
      new_content = original_content.replace('@resource',
                                         'from %s:' % (original_sender,))
  ```


* Create a links bot in settings for an existing user. Use its credentials
in `~/.zuliprc-local`. Subscribe the bot to `devel` and `social` streams.

* Check that the bot is working as expected:

  - it reacts to messages starting with `@link` and `@resource`
  - it currently posts the message to the `followup` stream, as the followup
  bot did

* Edit the `handle_message`:

  ```
  client.send_message(dict(
      type='private',
      to=original_sender,
      content=new_content,
  ))
  ```

* Check that the bot is working as expected:

  - it reacts to messages starting with `@link` and `@resource`

  - it sends a private message to the sender of the original message

* Take screenshots showing that the bot is working, make sure to have
screenshots of:

 - your terminal window with the bot running, including the command you used
 to run the bot and the output with the bot description
 - messages sent by you to the bot in the `devel` and `social` streams
 - messages sent by the bot in the private messages to the author
 - any other screenshots you find relevant

 Add the screenshots to `interactive-bots/links/<username>/`. Make sure your
 filenames do not have white spaces. Instead, use dashes (`-`).

* Note down any places you got stuck, problems or errors you ran into while
doing this setup process. Add your notes as a `notes.md` file to
`interactive-bots/links/<username>/`.

* Create a commit with the screenshots and notes, with commit message
`interactive bots: Run the links bot for <username>.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip-gci` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Run the links bot for <username>`. Link to your GCI task
in comment section.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check that the links bot was properly
set up.

### Task Type C: Create an interactive bot

We recommend claiming this task type after completing Task Type A
and Task Type B.

Let *feature* be the feature mentioned in the task that brought you here.

* Make sure you understand what is expected of the *feature* - what messages
should the bot react to, what should it do with the message content and
where should it post any output. Should you have any doubts, discuss them in
the Zulip `GCI tasks` stream.

* Create the interactive bot at `~/zulip/contrib_bots/lib/<feature>` as a
`<feature>.py` file. Make sure it fulfills the requirements.

* Test your bot manually, check that:

  * The bot is reacting to the appropriate messages.
  * The bot uses the content from the messages properly.
  * The bot posts the expected output.

* Create a commit with your bot, with commit message `interactive bots:
Create *feature* bot.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Create *feature* bot.`. Link to your GCI task in
the comment section on GitHub.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check if the new bot fulfills the
feature requirements.

### Task Type D: Create your own bot

We recommend claiming this task type after completing Task Type A and Task
Type B.

* Come up with an idea for your own interactive bot that would improve Zulip.
Make sure to make clear what would be expected of the bot - the kind of
messages it should react to, what it should do with the message content and
where it should post any output.

* Present your idea for an interactive bot on the `interactive bots` topic
on the `GCI tasks` stream. Consult with mentors and make sure your idea is
approved before you start coding.

* Create your interactive bot at `~/zulip/contrib_bots/lib/<bot_name>` as a
`<bot_name>.py` file. Make sure it fulfills the requirements.

* Test your bot manually, check that:

  * The bot is reacting to the appropriate messages.
  * The bot uses the content from the messages properly.
  * The bot posts the expected output.

* Document your interactive bot at `~/zulip/contrib_bots/lib/<bot_name>` in
a `docs.md` (about the bot, how the bot works, what the bot does, etc.). Add
any relevant screenshots that will help understand how the bot works.

* Create a commit with your bot, with commit message `interactive bots:
Create <bot_name> bot.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Create <bot_name> bot by <username>.`. Link to your GCI
task in the comment section on GitHub.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check if the new bot fulfills the feature
requirements.
