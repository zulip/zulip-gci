#GCI Tasks: interactive bots

## Prerequisites

* A working Zulip development environment. See
  https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/README.md for instructions on
  how to set one up.

* You need to know how to create a GitHub pull request. Check out the
  [Learn how to create a GitHub Pull Request](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/6541581402243072/)
  task if you aren't sure how to do this, or read through the task description
  [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/tasks/submit-a-pull-request.md).

* Update your working copy of Zulip and then create a feature branch. [Learn
  how](../before-every-task.md).

## Background

Zulip [contrib-bots](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/tree/master/contrib_bots/lib)
is a boilerplate for creating interactive bots that react to messages sent
by users.

The interactive bots live in the `contrib-bots/lib` as `.py` files that define
their specific behavior. The `contrib-bots/run.py` file defines common behaviors
for the interactive bots that react to messages.

The following tasks will introduce you to using interactive bots and creating
simple new bots that react to messages. This group of tasks has a high creative
potential, as you can create your own bots that react to specific messages and
can be integrated with various APIs.

## Task Descriptions

There are four types of tasks in this category, each corresponding to one of the
 Task Types below.

### Task Type A: Learn about interactive bots by running the followup bot

Follow the tutorial below to test run the followup bot on your Zulip instance
(either local or in your droplet).

* Run the Zulip server and log in the browser as Cordelia.

* Find the API keys.

  You can get API keys just below the bots section in the settings page. This
  is how Zulip knows the request is from an authorized user.

  You can also create a new bot for a user in settings - it will have its own
  API key and email. Remember to subscribe it to the streams you want to use the
   bot in.

* Create a `~/.zuliprc-local` file with credentials:

  ```
  [api]
  key=<api-key>
  email=<email>
  site=<dev-url>
  ```

  Replace the placeholder `<api-key>` in the example with an existing user API
  key and placeholder `<email>` with the user email. The placeholder `<dev-url>`
  should point to your development environment URL.

  If you're running your bot in the droplet, alongside your Zulip instance, the
  `<dev-url>` will be `localhost:9991`.

* Create a `followup` stream.

* Use `Manage Streams` to subscribe your bot (if you created one) to the following streams: `devel`,
`social`, and `followup`.

* Run the followup bot outside of your VM:

  ```
  cd ~/zulip/contrib_bots
  python run.py lib/followup.py --config-file ~/.zuliprc-local
  ```

  Make sure to point to your `.zuliprc-local` file - if you have created it in
  a different folder than `~`, you have to point to the right folder, e.g.
  `../../.zuliprc-local`.

* Test manually that the followup bot is working on the local Zulip instance,
by:

  a. sending a few messages starting with `@followup` and `@follow-up` from
  different streams, such as `devel` and `social`

  b. checking that the messages showed up in the `followup` stream, prepended by
  the sender email

* Take screenshots showing that the bot is working, make sure to have screenshots
of:

 - your terminal window with the bot running, including the command you used to
 run the bot and the output with the bot description
 - messages sent to the bot in the `devel` and `social` streams
 - messages sent by the bot in the followup stream
 - any other screenshots you find relevant

Add the screenshots to `interactive-bots/followup/<username>/`. Make sure your
filenames include no white spaces or underscores, use dashes (`-`) as connectors.

* Note down any places you got stuck, problems or errors you ran into while
doing this setup process. Add your notes as a `notes.md` file to
`interactive-bots/followup/<username>/`.

* Create a commit with the screenshots and notes, with commit message
`interactive bots: Run the followup bot for <username>.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip-gci` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Run the followup bot for <username>`.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check that the followup bot was properly
set up.

### Task Type B: Learn about interactive bots by creating a links bot

We recommend completing Task Type A before doing this task.

Follow the tutorial below to create your first simple bot that sends private
messages to users.

* Make a copy of `followup.py` under `contrib_bots/lib` and name it `links.py`, to build on existing code.
  ```
  cp followup.py links.py
  ```


* Change the class name to `LinksHandler` and the last line to `handler_class
= LinksHandler`.


* Edit the comment  in `class LinksHandler(object)` appropriately:

  > This plugin facilitates creating a list of resources you want to save while
  using Zulip. It looks for messages starting with "@link" or "@resource".
  > In this example, we send resources to private messages.

* Edit the return statement in `def usage(self)`:

  > This plugin will allow users to flag messages as being resources and store
  them in private messages with the bot. Users should preface messages with
  "@link" or "@resource".


* Edit the comments of `triage_message`:

  ```
  # This next line of code is defensive, as we
  # never want to get into an infinite loop of posting links
  # for own links!
  ```


* Edit the if statements of `triage_message`:

  ```
  if message['display_recipient'] == 'followup':
      return False
  is_link = (original_content.startswith('@link') or
             original_content.startswith('@resource'))

  return is_link
  ```

  The bot now responds to `@link` and `@resource`.


* Edit the if statements of `handle_message`:

  ```
  if original_content.startswith('@link'):
      new_content = original_content.replace('@link',
                                         'from %s:' % (original_sender,))
  else:
      new_content = original_content.replace('@resource',
                                         'from %s:' % (original_sender,))
  ```


* Create a links bot in settings for an existing user. Use its credentials in
`~/.zuliprc-local`. Subscribe the bot to `devel` and `social` streams.

* Check that the bot is working as expected:

  - it reacts to the `@link` and `@resource` at the beginning of a message

  - it currently posts the message to the followup stream, as the followup bot
  would

* Edit the `handle_message`:

  ```
  client.send_message(dict(
      type='private',
      to=original_sender,
      content=new_content,
  ))
  ```

* Check that the bot is working as expected:

  - it reacts to the `@link` and `@resource` at the beginning of a message

  - it sends a private message to the author of the original message

* Take screenshots showing that the bot is working, make sure to have screenshots
of:

 - your terminal window with the bot running, including the command you used to
 run the bot and the output with the bot description
 - messages sent to the bot in the `devel` and `social` streams
 - messages sent by the bot in the private messages to the author
 - any other screenshots you find relevant

 Add the screenshots to `interactive-bots/links/<username>/`. Make sure your
 filenames include no white spaces or underscores, use dashes (`-`) as connectors.

* Note down any places you got stuck, problems or errors you ran into while
doing this setup process. Add your notes as a `notes.md` file to
`interactive-bots/links/<username>/`.

* Create a commit with the screenshots and notes, with commit message
`interactive bots: Run the links bot for <username>.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip-gci` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Run the links bot for <username>`.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check that the links bot was properly set up.

### Task Type C: Create an interactive bot

We recommend claiming one of these tasks after completing Task Type A
and Task Type B.

Let *feature* be the feature mentioned in the task that brought you here.

* Make sure you understand what is expected of the *feature* - what messages
should the bot react to, what should it do with the message content and where
should it post any output. Should you have any doubts, discuss them in the Zulip
`GCI tasks` stream.

* Create the interactive bot at `~/zulip/contrib_bots/lib/<feature>` as a
`<feature>.py` file. Make sure it fulfills the requirements.

* Test your bot manually, check that:

  * The bot is reacting to the appropriate messages.
  * The bot uses the content from the messages properly.
  * The bot posts the expected output.

* Create a commit with your bot, with commit message `interactive bots: Create
*feature* bot.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Create *feature* bot.`.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check if the new bot fulfills the feature
requirements.

### Task Type D: Create your own bot

We recommend claiming this task after completing Task Type A and Task Type B.

* Come up with an idea for your own interactive bot that would improve Zulip.
Make sure to make clear what would be expected of the bot -  what messages
should it react to, what should it do with the message content and where should
it post any output.

* Present your idea for an interactive bot on the `interactive bots` topic on
the `GCI tasks` stream. Consult with mentors and make sure your idea is approved
 before you start coding.

* Create your interactive bot at `~/zulip/contrib_bots/lib/<bot_name>` as a
`<bot_name>.py` file. Make sure it fulfills the requirements.

* Test your bot manually, check that:

  * The bot is reacting to the appropriate messages.
  * The bot uses the content from the messages properly.
  * The bot posts the expected output.

* Document your interactive bot at `~/zulip/contrib_bots/lib/<bot_name>` in a
`docs.md`. Add any relevant screenshots that will help understand how the bot
works.

* Create a commit with your bot, with commit message `interactive bots: Create
<bot_name> bot.`.

* Create a pull request in the `zulip/zulip` repository, with title
`interactive bots: Create <bot_name> bot by <username>.`.

*Completion criteria:* Mentors will check if the new bot fulfills the feature
requirements.
