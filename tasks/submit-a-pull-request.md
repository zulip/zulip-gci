# Submit A Pull Request to Zulip GCI Repository

This task is for getting you familiarize with the GitHub flow. 
If you are already familiar with making a pull request in GitHub feel
free to skip this task. 

We would recommend you to go through [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
if you are not familiar with making a pull request. The tutorial would teach you to fork, create a branch,
commit and make a new pull request just by using GitHub. You can also use command line (git) for 
creating branch and making commits. This is not necessary for completing this task but is a skill
that you should learn sooner or later. Here is a [great tutorial](https://try.github.io) if you want
to learn Git.

## Task

* Fork the [zulip-gci](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci) repository.
If you are not sure what `fork` means refer to [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork).

* Create a new branch called `submit-a-pull-request` in the forked repository.
If you are not sure what a branch is refer to [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch).

* Make a new folder `submit-a-pull-request/`**`username`** where **username** is your GitHub username.

* Create a new file called `hello-world.md` with the following content. Don't replace the username with 
your GitHub username for now.

```markdown
# Hello world

I am username. :tada:

```

* Now commit the change you just made as `Create hello-world.md.` Refer to [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#commit) 
if you are not sure what commit means.

* Now open the file again and replace `username` in the file with your actual GitHub username. 

* Now commit the changes you just made as `Add Github handle to hello-world.md.`

* Now go ahead and make Pull Request to zulip-gci. Refer to [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr)
if you don't know how to make a pull request.
