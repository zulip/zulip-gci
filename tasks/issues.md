# GCI Tasks: GitHub Issues

## Prerequisites

* A working Zulip development environment. See
  https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/README.md for instructions
  on how to set one up.

## Background

Zulip Issues (https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues) are the bugs and open
feature requests for the Zulip Project. A longer description of the issues types
is at
https://github.com/zulip/zulip#how-to-get-involved-with-contributing-to-zulip

Issues on the dashboard are generally bite sizes bugs or features but you may
work on any issue in the project. If an issue you want to work on is not of the
GCI Dashboard ask the GCI tasks stream for a mentor to add it.

## Task Description

Read the issue description and discussion. If you have any questions ask on the
Zulip Chat (set the topic to the issue number) or add to the discussion on Github.

When you have completed the task submit a pull request to the zulip github
respository. Make sure you reference the issue number in the
[commit message](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/version-control.html#commit-messages).
