# GCI Tasks: TITLE

## Prerequisites

We'll write the text for these later, and do a find and replace in all the
templates before GCI starts. If there is another prerequisite we haven't
thought of that might apply to more than one category, add it here!

* A working Zulip development environment. See
  https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/README.md for instructions
  on how to set one up.

* Update your working copy of Zulip and then create a feature branch. [Learn
  how](../before-every-task.md).

* CLONE_GIT_REPO (for anything that doesn't require a working dev environment)
* GET_MENTOR_PERMISSION
