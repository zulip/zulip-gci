# Zulip Google Code-In Mentor Repository

This repository also contains items generally related to Zulip's
participation in Google Code-In.

At the moment, this includes:

* `docs/`: Documentation that you can point students to in order to 
  help them learn about how open source works. 
* `scripts/`: Tools for iterating over the tasks in a category and
  creating actual GCI tasks out of them.
* `tasks/`: Template descriptions for large categories of tasks.  We
  put the bulk of the descriptions in this repo rather than in the GCI
  interface so that it's possible to update the documentation on how
  to do things as we see what folks find confusing.

For each major category of tasks, we'll want to have both a template
description under `tasks/` as well as a script under `scripts/` to import
the tasks into the GCI web application.  We'll run the relevant scripts
as tasks are ready to be published.
