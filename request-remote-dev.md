# How to request a remote Zulip dev instance

Zulip is participating in this year's [Google Code-in][google-gci]. To make it
easy for participants to get started, Digital Ocean is providing virtual
machines for participants.

Any Google Code-in participant may request a remote Zulip developer instance.

## Step 1: Join GitHub and create SSH Keys

To contribute to Zulip and to use a remote Zulip developer instance, you'll
need a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, sign up
[here][github-join].

You'll also need to [create ssh keys and add them to your GitHub
account][github-help-add-ssh-key].

## Step 2: Create a fork of zulip/zulip

Zulip uses a **forked-repo** and **[rebase][gitbook-rebase]-oriented
workflow**. This means that all contributors create a fork of the [Zulip
repository][github-zulip-zulip] they want to contribute to and then submit pull
requests to the upstream repository to have their contributions reviewed and
accepted.

When we create your Zulip dev instance, we'll connect it to your fork of Zulip,
so that needs to exist before you make your request.

While you're logged in to GitHub, navigate to [zulip/zulip][github-zulip-zulip]
and click the **Fork** button. (See [GitHub's help article][github-help-fork]
for further details).

## Step 3: Make request via chat.zulip.org

Now that you have a GitHub account, have added your ssh keys, and forked
zulip/zulip, you are ready to request your Zulip developer instance.

If you haven't already, create an account on https://chat.zulip.org/.

Next, join the **GCI help** stream. Create a new **stream message**
with your GitHub username as the **topic** and request your remote dev
instance.  A mentor should reply letting you know they're working on
creating it as soon as they are available to help (they'll be using
the tool in `remotedev/create.py` in this repository).

Once requested, it will only take a few minutes to create your instance. Your
mentor will let you know when it is complete and available.

## Next steps

Once your remote dev instance is ready:

- Connect to your server by running
  `ssh zulipdev@<username>.zulipdev.org` on the command line
  (Terminal for macOS and Linux, Bash for Git on Windows).
- There is no password; your account is configured to use your ssh keys.
- Once you log in, you should see `(zulip-venv) ~$`.
- To start the dev server, `cd zulip` and then run `./tools/run-dev.py`.
- While the dev server is running, you can see the Zulip server in your browser
  at http://username.zulipdev.org:9991.

Once you've confirmed you can connect to your remote server, take a look at:

  instance, and
* our [Git & GitHub Guide][rtd-git-guide] to learn how to use Git with Zulip.
