# Intro

While reviewing pull requests on `zulip-gci` and submissions in the GCI app, and
when helping students on Zulip, I've encountered some common problems.

The students are learning a lot and they are eager to tackle the challenges.
That's why I'm always positive:

  * I thank the student for their contribution

    `Thanks for posting the pull request! Looks great.`

  * I point out the issues in their submission

  * I ask them to fix the issues and thank them

    ```
    Could you submit your task in the app?

    Thanks!
    ```

This document is a short list of common issues and some ideas on how to address
them.

## GitHub

### Student posts a PR without submitting the task

I ask the student if they have claimed and submitted the task:

`This looks great! Have you claimed and submitted the task in the GCI app?`

Some students say they'll do it after their PR is merged - I ask them to submit
the task in the GCI app, with more details:

```
You should submit the task in the GCI app, so the mentors know what they should
review - the flow of reviewing the tasks is first claiming them in the app, then
submitting and waiting for mentor review, then resubmitting them should there be
a need for fixes.

Could you submit your task in the app?
```

### Student opens another PR on the same task

I go to all the previous PRs on this task and close them with comment:

`Another PR for this was opened at <PR_hash>`

I also ask the student to learn how to review and edit their commit history:

```
You don't have to open a new pull request each time you want to change what
you've submitted - for future reference you can use
[this guide](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/docs/fixing-commits.md)
for fixing your commits.
```

### Student doesn't know how to edit commit history

I point them to docs:

```
Some helpful docs:

- [Git guide](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-guide.html)
- [working copies](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/docs/working-copies.md)
- [fixing commits](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/docs/fixing-commits.md)
```

### Student has the same problem for a prolonged time/the problem became complicated

I ask them to join us on Zulip, since it's much easier to discuss there:

`Can you come and chat with us on [Zulip](https://chat.zulip.org/)?`

## GCI app

### Student resubmits the task without properly reviewing it

I ask the student to make sure they don't have any obvious issues in their code
before resubmitting:

`Please make sure to look through all the files before you submit the task for
review.`

## Zulip

### Student pings mentors constantly for reviews

I inform the student there is a queue of submissions and their submission will be
reviewed shortly:

`the task is in the submissions queue, a mentor will get to it at some point
today`
