# General Rules

Thank you for considering to contribute to the German translation!
Before you start writing, please make sure that you have read the
following general translation rules.

## Formal or Informal?

**Informal.**

Although written German tends to be quite formal, websites in German are
usually following informal netiquette. As Zulip's guides are written
in a more colloquial style, German translations should be rather informal as well.

**Don't use slang or regional phrases in the German translation:**

* Instead of *"So'n Dreck kann jedem mal passieren."*, you could
say *"Dieser Fehler tritt häufiger auf."*

* "Das ist die Seite, wo der Quelltext steht." - the "*wo*" is regional,
say *"Das ist die Seite, auf der der Quelltext steht."* instead.

## Form of address

**Use "Du" instead of "Sie".**

For the reasons provided in [the previous section](#formal-or-informal),
stick to *Du* (informal) instead of *Sie* (formal) when addressing
the reader and remember to capitalize *Du*.

## Form of instruction

**Prefer imperative over constructions with auxiliary verbs.**

For instructions, try to use the imperative (e.g. *"Gehe auf die Seite"* -
*"Go to the page"*) instead of constructions with auxiliary verbs
(e.g. *"Du musst auf die Seite ... gehen"* - *"You have to go the page ..."*).
This keeps the phrases short, less stiff and avoids unnecessary addressings
of the reader.

## Rules for labels

**Use continuous labels with verbs in infinitive form**

To be consistent with other online platforms, use continuous labels for buttons,
item titles, etc. with verbs in infinitive form,
e.g. *Manage streams* - *Kanäle verwalten* instead of *Verwalte Kanäle*.

## Concatenation of words

**Try to avoid it.**

German is famous for its concatenations of nouns
(e.g. *Heizölrückstoßdämpfung*, which means *fuel oil recoil attenuation*).
For the sake of correct rendering and simplicity, you should try to avoid such
concatenations whenever possible, since they can break the layout of the Zulip
frontend. Try to stick to a maximum length of 20 characters and follow your
intuition.

* A term like *Tastaturkürzel* for *Keyboard shortcuts* is fine - it is
shorter than 20 characters and commonly used in web applications.

* A term like *Benachrichtigungsstichwörter* for *Alert words* should
not be used, it sounds odd and is longer than 20 characters.
You could use "*Stichwörter, die mich benachrichtigen*" instead.

## Anglicisms

**Use them if other web apps do so and a teenager could understand the term.**

Unlike other languages, German happily adapts modern words from English.
This becomes even more evident in internet applications,
so you should not be afraid of using them if they provide an advantage over
the German equivalent. Take the following two examples as a reference:

* Translating *Stream*: Use the German word *Kanal*, since it is just as short
and used in other web apps.

* Translating *Bot*: Use *Bot*, as a completely accurate German
equivalent **doesn't** exist (e.g. *Roboter*) and the term *Bot* is not
unknown to German speakers.

## Special characters

**Use "ä, ö, ü" and "ß" consistently.**

While *ä, ö, ü* and *ß* are more and more being replaced by *ae, oe, ue*
and *ss* in chats, forums and even websites, German translations
containing umlauts have a more trustworthy appearance.
For capitalizations, you can replace the *ß* by *ss*.

## False friends

**Watch out!**

A false friend is a word in another language that is spelled
or sounds similar to a word in one's own language, 
yet has a different meaning.
False friends for the translation from German to English include
*actually* - *eigentlich*, *eventually* - *schließlich*, *map* - *Karte*, etc.
Make sure to not walk into such a trap.

## Other

* Try to keep words and phrases short and understandable. The front-end
developers will thank you ;)

* Be consistent. Use the same terms for the same things, even if that
means repeating. Have a look at other German translations on Zulip
to get a feeling for the vocabulary.

* Balance common verbs and nouns with specific IT-related translations
of English terms - this can be tricky, try to check how other resources
were translated (e.g. GMail, Microsoft websites, Facebook) to decide
what wouldn't sound awkward / rude in German.

* For additional translation information, feel free to check out
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translating_German_WP) Wikipedia guide
on translating German Wikipedia articles into English.

Some terms are very tricky to translate, so be sure to communicate with other German
speakers in the community. It's all about making Zulip friendly and usable.
