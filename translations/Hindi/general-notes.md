# General Rules

Thank you for considering to contribute to the Hindi translation! Before you
start contributing, please make sure to read the following general rules.

## Formal or Informal?

**Somewhere in the middle, but for the most part Informal.**

Although written Hindi in print media is quite formal, websites and social
networks using Hindi are usually following informal netiquette but with a bit
of formality, the sentences construed for different web products online are
well punctuated and are not fragmented. As the Zulip guides are written in a
more colloquial style, their Hindi counter parts should take up the same spirit.

## Forms of address
**Use  _"आप"_ instead of _"तुम"_ or _"तु"_.** It's quite common to use _"तुम"_
or _"तु"_ in everyday spoken Hindi with friends and family, but we should try
to avoid this as many consider this to be disrespectful.

## Other
* Try to keep words and phrases short and understandable. Using a formal form
of Hindi will result in the users of Zulip getting confused.

* Be consistent. Use the same terms for the same things, uniformity within the
Zulip environment is important. Example: using _"संगठन"_ at one place and
_"टीम"_ at another place will confuse the users.

* Have a look at other Hindi translations on Zulip to get a feeling for the
vocabulary.

* Balance common verbs and nouns with specific IT-related translations of
English terms - this can be tricky, try to check how other resources were
translated (e.g. Twitter, Microsoft websites, Facebook, Google products) to
decide what wouldn't sound awkward in Hindi.

* Some terms are very tricky to translate, so be sure to communicate with other
Hindi speakers in the community. It's all about making Zulip friendly and
usable. It's a good idea to discuss your confusions with the Zulip community to
get them resolved faster.
