General notes:

* The main difference between Polish and English writing are the special
 characters, in English, there is no ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ś, ó, ż, ź.
* Polish grammar differs much from the English. What matters in the 
context of websites, texts are usually longer in Polish.
* Polish and English are both written from left to right.

Thoughts after analysing the screenshots:
 
* Polish words and sentences are quite often longer which forces sites to 
adjust. For instance in English Google_preferences fit above the fold, but
I had to scroll the site in Polish. 
* Sometimes fonts don't support Polish special characters and therefore 
break site's look (e.g. Instagram).
* Some sites are inconsistent. Content in different languages differs. Same
 applies to design, for example Wikipedia home page has a different header
* Comparing formality sites did not really differ, content kept its style.


The style used, was rather informal than formal, although it wasn't
completely informal. Some sites like Wikipedia had more formal style than
for example Twitter home page. Also more formal, I'd say sections, were
written more formally (e.g. Settings on Facebook).

Formal forms such like Mr., Mrs., Sir or Madam weren't used on any of 
the analysed sites and in my opinion they shouldn't be used because then 
text would sound too formal (of course there will be some exceptions).
Quite balanced language fits best in almost any context so that's why 
I think it should be used in most of the cases.
