General notes:

* The main diversity between Polish and English writing are the special letters, in English, there is no ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ś, ó, ż, ź.
* Polish grammar differs much from the English. What matters in the context of websites, texts are usually longer in Polish.
* Polish and English are both written from left to right.

Thoughts after analysing the screenshots:
 
* Polish words and sentences are quite often longer what forces sites to scale. For instance: Google_preferences, what fitted on one site displayed in English, I had to scroll in Polish.
* Sometimes fonts don't support polish special letters and therefore break site's look (e.g. Instagram)
* Some sites are inconsistent. Content in different languages differs. Same applies to design, on Wikipedia for example home page, has a different header. 
* Comparing formality sites did not really differ, content kept it's style.
