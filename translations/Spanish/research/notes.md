# Spanish language research for Zulip  

Most sites use an informal (yet not colloquial) language, avoiding the formal
"you".

In some justified cases, the use of words taken from English is okay and fits
properly (e.g. *feeds*).

Even though there are some differences between European and Latin American
Spanish, it's normally used either a neutral version or the European one, if
not possible otherwise. This means avoiding pronouns like "ustedes" or "vos", in
favor of "vosotros", "tú".

As already stated in the already existing style guide, the predominant tense is
the imperative, and reflexives are avoided most of the times.

Spanish is a left-to-right language, but has some non-ASCII characters: `ñ/Ñ`,
`¿`, `á/Á`, `é/É`, `í/Í`, `ó/Ó`, `ú/Ú`, `ü`. These are included in the
ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) character set.
