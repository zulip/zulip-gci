## Heroku

Heroku is a cloud application platform that allows easy and rapid deployment of apps.

Heroku provides deploy webhooks which can send notifications when a new version of an app is deployed.

I add a Heroku integration to Slack, but adding a Slack API endpoint to the Deploy Webhooks addon in Heroku.

These are the messages that were posted in the Slack team when the app was deployed:
