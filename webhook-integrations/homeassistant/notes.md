# Home assistant integration

HomeAssistant is a python API/cloud service for IOT devices.

At first impression it does not appear to have webhook support.
HomeAssistant will also have problems, as it is generally run locally instead
of in the cloud.
The slack integration uses the homeassistant API, and a homeassistant
integration for Zulip would mean more than just reading some webhooks.

Integration is beyond the scope of GCI and probably more pain than it's worth.
