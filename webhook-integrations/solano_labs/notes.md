There currently isn't a slack integration for Solano Labs, but since it's a continuous integration
service, the data is similar to other ci services like Travis. Therefore we can structure the messages
within zulip similar to the structure of the travis ci integration: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/images/integrations/travis/001.png.
