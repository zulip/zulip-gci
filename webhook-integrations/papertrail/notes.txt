Papertrail
    Papertrail only sends logs to its integrated tools.
    Papertrail log extract works for nearly every device or software.
    Logs are sent via link that is generated by the integrated tools.
    I've used a tool named Slack, created an account (team),
    Searched for papertrail and generated a link posting the logs
    in #general(group), Made an account in papertrailapp.com
    and configured it using my pc's logs and set an alert for 
    the link that was generated by slack, And therefore it worked.
    This is the way papertrail works.
