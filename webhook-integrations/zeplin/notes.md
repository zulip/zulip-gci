# Zeplin integration

Purpose:
- The integration should notify zeplin users when new designs are uploaded, resources are updated and new messages/replies from your teammates come in


Issues:
- Lack of documentation - there is nothing to suggest that webhook integration is possible let alone how to do it.
- Lack of functionality on free account - so no ability to test Slack's integration.

Probably slack has collaborated with zeplin to create the integration.

If zeplin devs reply to my message with info, I may come back to this task.
