The Go Squared integration research task provides many difficulties that I think should be addressed. 
First, the suggested webhook inspector,  RequestBin, does not work with Go Squaredâ€™s webhook interface, 
because Go Squared requires a https communication for it to function, which RequestBin does not use. 
So I had to use HookBin which was not mentioned in the guide. 
Also whenever I attempted to triggered a request to be sent to the webhook inspector only once 
was I able to provide an output to the Slack chatroom and never was able to receive a webhook request. 
Even when attempting to replicate my actions the I never received output on Slack again. 
This task in my opinion needs to be reviewed for more errors than the ones I saw.
